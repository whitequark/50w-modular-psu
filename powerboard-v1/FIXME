 * vias not connected to GND
 * not enough space for heatsink
 * inductor heating up like crazy
 * GDT is 12-12-12
 * power trafo is 2-2-130 with center tap
 * HV output close to analog causes arcing
 * isolated stage over 2 turns breaks down BAT70
 * vias not covered by soldermask
 * rework on inductor sucks
 * rework on components near power trafo sucks
 * add power on analog connector
